# Housing-Price-Prediction (Practice Problem)
This model of Predicting the Sales Price of House when provided with House Sq.ft, Area and many other Parameters as predictors.

Process of Writing the Code includes following Steps:

A) Importing all the required Packages
B) Loading all the necessary data
C) Data Exploration
D) Data Visualization (Look for Linearity in the predictors for the target variable)
E) Split the Target Variable from the original Data.
F) Apply Correlation for the Target variable and look for the correlated features using correlation matrix anf heat maps.
G) Data Cleaning (Removing all the Null Values/NaN's from the Dataset)
H) Removing the necessary Outliers
I) Apply Ridge Regession Algorithm to the training data.
J) Measure your Training Accuracy
K) Train your data using the Random Forest Model.
L) Measure your Training Accuracy
M) Apply XGBOOST to tune the parameters and improve the accuracy
N) Test the Accuracy of the Model using the unknown test data.
O) Make Final Submission.
